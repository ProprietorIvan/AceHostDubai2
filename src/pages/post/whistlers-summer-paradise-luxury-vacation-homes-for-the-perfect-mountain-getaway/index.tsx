This architectural masterpiece features walls of glass that frame postcard-perfect views of Whistler Valley and the surrounding mountains dressed in their summer splendor.

                What truly sets Whistler apart as a summer destination is the incredible diversity and beauty of its views. From any of our luxury properties, guests are treated to an ever-changing panorama that captures the essence of mountain living in its most spectacular form. Morning brings misty valleys with sunlight gradually illuminating the mountain peaks, while evenings offer the famous "alpenglow"—when the setting sun bathes the mountains in hues of pink and gold.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Each of our properties offers a unique vantage point to appreciate Whistler's natural splendor. The elevated position of our Kadenwood properties—including Panoramic Estate, Slope Side Chalet, Chalet La Forja, and Altitude Retreat—provides sweeping views of the entire valley, while our Blueberry Hill property, Falcon, offers a perfect perspective of Alpha Lake framed by mountain peaks. Even our village property, Heron Views, delivers stunning mountain vistas from a convenient central location.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                These views become the backdrop for unforgettable summer moments: morning coffee on the deck as the valley awakens, afternoon relaxation by the pool or hot tub surrounded by mountain grandeur, and evening gatherings under a canvas of stars. Whether you're watching eagles soar above the valley, marveling at wildflower-covered slopes, or simply taking in the majesty of the Coast Mountains, Whistler's summer views create the perfect setting for a luxury mountain getaway.
