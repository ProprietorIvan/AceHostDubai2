                What to Consider When Renting Long-Term in Whistler
              </h2>

              <p>
                Finding the perfect long-term rental in Whistler requires
                consideration of several factors. Here are some essential points
                to keep in mind as you begin your search:
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">
                1. Location and Accessibility
              </h3>
              <p>
                Consider how close you want to be to the ski lifts, village
                amenities, or specific neighborhoods. Do you prioritize
                ski-in/ski-out access or prefer a quieter location away from the
                hustle and bustle? Whistler offers various neighborhoods, each
                with its unique charm and convenience levels.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">
                2. Seasonal Considerations
              </h3>
              <p>
                Whistler experiences distinct seasons, each offering unique
                activities and lifestyle benefits. Winter rentals provide easy
                access to world-class skiing and snowboarding, while summer
                rentals offer hiking, mountain biking, and golf opportunities.
                Consider which season(s) you'll be staying in Whistler and
                choose a property that maximizes your enjoyment of those
                activities.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Long-term rentals in Whistler vary significantly in price
                depending on location, size, amenities, and season. While
