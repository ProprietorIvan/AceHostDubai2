                Buying or managing a short term rental property is a great way
                of making passive income, especially in the tourism-driven town
                of Whistler. A town that experiences a significant influx of
                tourists seasonally, Whistler has proved to be a hotspot for
                short term rental profits year after year. AceHost Whistler has
                put together a guide on why you should enter the short-term
                rental market in Whistler and why AceHost should be your first

                Offering outdoor activities all year round, Whistler has proven

                Whistler attracts many wealthy travellers looking for luxury
                full-service accommodations. The steady growth of travellers and
                demand for high-end rental properties suggests that the supply
                of luxury accommodations is never enough. As a result, there is
                never a bad time to invest in Whistler real estate.
