                If you thought Whistler was all about the slopes, think again. Sure, the skiing is legendary, but tucked among the towering pines and snowy peaks are some of the most jaw-dropping luxury rental homes in Canada—and AceHost is your golden ticket to all of them.

                This isn't your average Airbnb game. We're talking architecturally stunning estates, private chefs whipping up truffle risottos, and ski-in/ski-out chalets where you can roll out of bed and glide straight onto a powdery run. Whether you're planning a lavish family reunion, a New Year's Eve you'll never forget, or just want a holiday where someone else makes your morning cappuccino while you soak in a mountainside hot tub—AceHost has your name on it.

              <p>
                AceHost curates Whistler's most exclusive, high-end homes—many of which you won't even find publicly listed. We're talking about places with 7+ bedrooms, private theatres, wine cellars, stone fireplaces big enough to roast a small elk (not recommended), and decks that practically hover over the valley. These aren't just places to stay—they're destinations.

                Christmas and New Year's in Whistler? Unmatched. Think snow-dusted trees, twinkling lights, fresh tracks in the morning and champagne toasts at night.

              <p>
