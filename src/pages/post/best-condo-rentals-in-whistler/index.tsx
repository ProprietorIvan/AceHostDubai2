                Finding Your Perfect Whistler Condo: Location Guide
              </h2>

              <p>
                When choosing a Whistler condo, location can make or break your vacation experience. Here's a quick guide to Whistler's most sought-after neighborhoods:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Whistler Village:</strong> The bustling heart of Whistler, offering walking access to gondolas, restaurants, shopping, and nightlife. Perfect for those who want to be in the center of the action.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Upper Village:</strong> At the base of Blackcomb Mountain, this quieter area offers excellent ski access while being just a short walk from the main village. Many properties here offer true ski-in/ski-out convenience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Village North:</strong> A slightly quieter extension of the main village with excellent amenities and typically more affordable options, still within easy walking distance to lifts and attractions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Creekside:</strong> The original base of Whistler Mountain, this charming area offers a more laid-back vibe, its own gondola, and amenities like grocery stores and restaurants – all with typically better value than village properties.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p className="mt-6">
                For most first-time visitors, staying in or near the Village provides the quintessential Whistler experience, putting everything from gondolas to grocery stores within walking distance. If ski access is your top priority, look for properties in Upper Village or with "ski-in/ski-out" in their descriptions.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-16 mb-6">
                Why Choose a Condo for Your Whistler Stay?
              </h2>

              <p>
                Condos offer some distinct advantages over hotel rooms when visiting Whistler:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Space to Spread Out:</strong> With separate bedrooms and living areas, condos give everyone room to relax after active days on the mountain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Kitchen Facilities:</strong> Save money and enjoy flexibility by preparing some meals in your fully equipped kitchen – especially helpful for families and longer stays.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Value for Groups:</strong> When traveling with family or friends, condos often provide better value per person than booking multiple hotel rooms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Local Experience:</strong> Stay like a local with residential amenities and neighborhoods that hotels can't offer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Building Amenities:</strong> Many condo buildings feature hot tubs, pools, fitness centers, and other perks included in your stay.
                </li>
              </ul>
